# wireshark-zabbix-dissectors

Experimental Wireshark dissectors for Zabbix protocol.

Tested with various versions, like:
- Zabbix 4.0.0, 4.0.9, 4.0.14, 4.4.4, 6.2.0
- Wireshark (on 64-bit Windows) 2.6.x, 3.0.2, 3.2.1, 3.6.6
- (not in all combinations but to give you an idea)

Use at your own risk.

See the commit history for the changes.

## Install instructions for Wireshark on Windows (64-bit)

1. Go to `%APPDATA%\Wireshark` folder
1. Create `plugins` folder if it does not exist yet, and go there
1. Copy the `.lua` files there (alternatively you can also create a subfolder and
place the files there, or clone this repo under the `plugins` folder)
1. If Wireshark is already running, use **Analyze - Reload Lua Plugins** (Ctrl-Shift-L)
1. Enable TCP setting **Allow subdissector to reassemble TCP streams**
to give you correct output when requests/responses do not fit in one
IP packet
1. Edit Zabbix protocol preferences as needed (in **Preferences - Protocols**, or
by right-clicking in Zabbix/ZabbixAgent packets in capture window)

## Usage hints

You can use the provided samples to test the dissectors. For the display filters:

- Use `zabbix or zabbixagent` to show only Zabbix protocol messages
- Use `zabbix.agent` (or `zabbix.proxy`) to show only agent (proxy) messages
- Use `zabbix.agent.activechecks == 1` to show the active agents requesting for items
to check for
- Use `zabbix.agent.data == 1` to show the active agents sending data to Zabbix server/proxy
- Try `zabbix.agent.name` as a column
- `zabbix.datalen` always returns the uncompressed length, regardless of
compression or TCP reassembly in use or not

Add a column for `zabbix.time or zabbixagent.time` to display the time between
request and response. (You can even set it to
`zabbix.time or zabbixagent.time or icmp.resptime or icmpv6.resptime or http.time or dns.time`
and so on to show your other response times in the same column.)

See the Zabbix protocol tree in captured packets to see other fields that are
available for filtering, or go to **View - Internals - Supported Protocols** and
filter for Zabbix to see all the registered fields. Or just enter `zabbix.` or
`zabbixagent.` in the display filter and browse the list.

TLS decryption can be used if configured properly in Wireshark and also in
capturing (session keys are needed at least with TLS 1.3, see for example
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/215358/extracting-openssl-pre-master-secret-from-apache2/215397#215397).
The provided TLS samples include the session keys embedded in the capture files
(https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS#Embedding_decryption_secrets_in_a_pcapng_file).

## Limitations

- Code assumes Zabbix-generated "compact" form of JSON (no extra spaces or line feeds)
- Not all Zabbix component combinations have been tested or implemented
- Large packet support (used for multi-gigabyte proxy configurations as of 7/2022) is implemented
with separate `zabbix.large.*` fields
- Lua dissector performance is not as good as in C dissectors
- Wireshark can/will crash if a Lua dissector field is used in a custom column, and you reload the
Lua plugins or you change to a profile using those custom fields (workaround for the latter is
to select the profile before opening any capture file in Wireshark); see
